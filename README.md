# What is this?
Ever want to make a site with a rotating list of phrases as it's only content? This is your answer!
Simply copy the `JokeSite.html` file, and specify phrases/their percent chance of appearing in the `PercentChooser` that is initialized, and any other branding. Boom! Your site is ready to be served up.

# What is guaranteed?
Every time the site loads, a new joke phrase will be shown. Across all refreshes, each option will show up the specified percentage of the time. You will never see the same joke phrase twice in a row.
